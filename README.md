    To determine the user’s needs it is important to define them before any programing is done. This is done by analyzing all the requirements and using models. 
    When I first start, I ask myself who, what, when, why, and how. This allows me to understand the full scope of the project. 
    Then the next step would be the creation of requirement tests to make sure they were all implemented correctly. 
    It is important to use proper testing methods make sure we meet all the user’s requirements. 
    To do this we use testing methods such as black-box and white-box testing, along with other styles to use to ensure that the code is functional and secure.
    In conclusion we define the requirements then test the program as much as feasible to make sure we have a program that meets the user’s needs.
